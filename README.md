> _In this project, you will develop a cloud-based application for uploading, listing, and filtering images. You will use Node.js/Express, a popular Javascript framework for networked application development. You will implement a REST API to issue commands using HTTP, store data in Amazon Web Services Relational Data Service (RDS) and S3, extend the codebase with secure authentication signon features, and deploy to Amazon Web Services Elastic Beanstalk. These are the hard skills youâ€™ll need in any Cloud developer role._
